This repository contains code that will automatically detect the top 5 antennae from a GENETIS genetic algorithm loop. It will then run the top 5 antennae through AraSim, 
a neutrino simulation software, and then use the data from those simulations to output physics plots for those same antennae. This repository will contain a mix of python and
bash code.
