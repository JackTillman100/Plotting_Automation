##     This script is designed to read the fitness scores of all of the individuals in every generation
##     after the genetic algorithm (the loop) is ran and output the top 5 individuals along with their fitness 
##     scores
##
## Instructions:
##              To run, give the following arguments:
##              directory of generation data
##                      
##
## Example:
##              python fitness_score_sorting.py generation_data_directory
##                      This will find the top 5 antenna once the loop is finished running
